TcUnit
======

I forked TcUnit by Stefan Henneken for primarly teaching myself using TDD, Git, GitHub and creating clean
code in general.

My secondary goals are
* extending the project by generic methods
* creating unit tests and therefore test drive the testing unit by itself
* improve and simplify the creation of unit tests
* transform the library into a similar form as Cpputest (because I read "TDD for Embedded C" right
  now - gread read btw)
